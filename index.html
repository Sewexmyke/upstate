                    <h3><span>+</span>Why is the front load washer often a better choice?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Top load washers are smaller capacity and less efficient. Front washers
                        provide a better wash and are gentler on your garments due to their
                        tumbling action. They need less soap (for example a double load front
                        load washer will need about 1 1/2 load’s worth of soap). Front load
                        washers are better value and more environmentally friendly.</p>
                    <h3><span>+</span>Can I wash my pillows in a front load washer?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>You can – but you need to aware of a few things. Pillows can
                        sometimes be damaged during wash and may lose stuffing or lose
                        it’s shape. Please use your best judgment.</p>
                    <h3><span>+</span>Can I wash a down comforter?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Comforters with down fillings take longer to dry. You may need to air
                        dry them at home to get the moisture out. Please take care to dry
                        them completely to prevent mildew.</p>
                    <h3><span>+</span>How do I add time to the dryers?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>You can add any amount of time to the dryer by inserting your laundry
                        card into the dryer until the desired drying time is reached.
